The flute is a woodwind instrument that produces sound from the flow of air across an opening. It does not use reeds, unlike other woodwinds. Modern flutes are usually made of metal and are played by blowing across the mouth hole while pressing keys to change pitch. It is used in classical, folk, and contemporary music.
