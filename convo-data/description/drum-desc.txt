The drum is a percussion instrument that produces sound by being struck with sticks or hands. It is used in classical, folk, and contemporary music worldwide. Drums vary in size and type, from snare drums and bass drums to hand drums like djembes and congas. Most drums consist of a cylindrical shell with a stretched membrane, known as a drumhead, on one or both ends.
