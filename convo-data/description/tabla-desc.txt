The tabla is a traditional Indian percussion instrument made of two drums: the smaller dayan (right hand) and the larger bayan (left hand). It is used in Hindustani classical music and fusion genres. The drumheads have a black spot in the center to fine-tune pitch and harmonics. Playing involves intricate finger and palm techniques.
