The guitar is a fretted string instrument usually with six strings. It is played by plucking or strumming and is used in nearly every genre of music. Guitars come in acoustic and electric forms, each with distinctive sound profiles. Acoustic guitars resonate through a hollow body; electric guitars require amplification.
